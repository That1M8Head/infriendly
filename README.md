> In a world dominated by smarts, perhaps stupid is better…

## Unstable

Infriendly is still in an unstable state. It's usable, but it's not ready for
production environments.

(To be fair, your mileage may vary even when we get to v1.0.)

## Preface

Infriendly is an online web platform for writing textual documents that
intentionally does not have any "smart" features. It's not "Unfriendly", it's
"Infriendly", because I like being wrong.

Unlike other writing platforms that offer auto-correct, grammar suggestions, or
formatting assistance, Infriendly aims to provide a simple and straightforward
environment for users to focus solely on their writing.

And there’s no generative AI features. You have to do the writing yourself, or
at least flip to a different tab to visit your favourite AI language model.
*It doesn’t even have auto-correct, what do you expect?*

Infriendly's minimalist approach appeals to those who prefer a clean and
distraction-free interface.

And when I say minimalist and distraction-free, I *mean it* — there’s nothing
but you, a browser window and your keyboard. There’s standard CUA keyboard
shortcuts, so you get easy access to your usual shortcuts, you know,
`Control-Z`, `Control-X`, `Control-C`, `Control-V`, which are provided by the
browser.

Infriendly's simplicity and lack of automated features may not appeal to
everyone. In fact, it's not designed to appeal to everyone. Many users prefer
the convenience and assistance provided by AI-powered writing tools.

However, for those who value a pure and unadulterated writing
experience, Infriendly offers a refreshing alternative.

## Usage

You can access Infriendly at `https://that1m8head.github.io/infriendly`.

Once you open it up, you’ll be greeted with a white screen (or `#222222` screen,
if you’re using dark mode) and a blinking text prompt.

Infriendly defaults to Markdown for formatting, and doesn’t let you use anything
else, because that would be a distraction.

## Offline Usage

Infriendly does not currently support offline usage. It is an online web
platform that requires an internet connection to access and use. However, you
can bookmark the URL `https://that1m8head.github.io/infriendly` to quickly
access Infriendly whenever you have an internet connection.

If you’re experienced in making web apps work offline, I’d appreciate the help.

don’t break Infriendly’s editing model.
